# Bug Fixes Summary - August 9, 2025

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ LLM Analyzer Import Error
**Error**: `cannot import name 'LLMAnalyzer' from 'models.llm_analyzer'`

**Root Cause**: The class in `models/llm_analyzer.py` is named `GeminiAnalyzer`, not `LLMAnalyzer`.

**Fix**: Updated import in `train_models.py` line 1625:
```python
# Before
from models.llm_analyzer import LLMAnalyzer
llm_analyzer = LLMAnalyzer()

# After  
from models.llm_analyzer import GeminiAnalyzer
llm_analyzer = GeminiAnalyzer()
```

### 2. ✅ CatBoost Single Target Value Error
**Error**: `Target contains only one unique value` - CatBoost failing when training data has only one class

**Root Cause**: After data balancing, some cross-validation folds might still contain only one class, causing CatBoost to fail.

**Fix**: Added single-class detection after balancing in `utils/stacking.py`:
- Line ~340: Added check after balancing in regular OOF stacking
- Line ~795: Added check after balancing in enhanced OOF stacking

```python
# Check if we still have multiple classes after balancing
if pd.Series(y_fold_balanced).nunique() < 2:
    logger.warning(f"Skipping fold {fold} for {model_name}: single-class after balancing.")
    continue
```

### 3. ✅ Plots Not Saving to Batch Folders
**Error**: Plots saving to `reports/` folder instead of `plots/` folder, so batch script couldn't find them to move.

**Root Cause**: 
- `train_models.py` was using `plot_dir="reports"` 
- All visualization functions in `utils/visualization.py` were using `ensure_reports_dir()`

**Fixes**:
1. Changed `train_models.py` line 818: `plot_dir="reports"` → `plot_dir="plots"`
2. Added `ensure_plots_dir()` function to `utils/visualization.py`
3. Updated all plot-saving functions to use `ensure_plots_dir()` instead of `ensure_reports_dir()`

## Verification

Created and ran comprehensive test suite (`test_bug_fixes.py`) that validates:
- ✅ LLM analyzer imports correctly with new class name
- ✅ Single class scenarios handled gracefully with warnings  
- ✅ Plot and reports directories are separate and correct
- ✅ CatBoost safety checks work properly

## Files Modified

1. **train_models.py**
   - Fixed LLM analyzer import (line 1625-1626)
   - Fixed plot directory (line 818)

2. **utils/stacking.py** 
   - Added single-class detection after balancing (lines ~340, ~795)

3. **utils/visualization.py**
   - Added `ensure_plots_dir()` function
   - Updated all plot-saving functions to use plots directory

## Impact

- ✅ Training pipeline now handles edge cases gracefully
- ✅ LLM features can be enabled without import errors
- ✅ Plots save to correct directory and get properly organized by batch script
- ✅ CatBoost and other models skip problematic folds instead of crashing
- ✅ Better error handling and logging for debugging

## Testing

All fixes validated with:
```bash
python test_bug_fixes.py
```

The training pipeline is now more robust and should handle the previously problematic scenarios without crashing.
